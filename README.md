# Referral and Rewards MVP

This is a small project I made in less than 24 hours.  
The idea is simple — each user gets a unique referral link.  
If someone signs up using that link, the owner of the link gets some random points (0–10).  
These points can be used later for discounts or other perks.

## Features

- Signup and login
- Each user gets their own referral link
- Random points are given when a friend signs up
